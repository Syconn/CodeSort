# 🌀 CodeSort 🌀
This project was completed as the final assignment for the Data Structures and Algorithms Honors course at the University of Delaware. The goal of this project was to create a game that is both engaging and teaches about different sorting algorithms. Our game teaches about selection, bubble, merge, quick, and insert sorts.
